## GraphQL API Consumer


```
#graphql #api #typescript
```



### Use Case

You are using GraphQL.  You are about to make a change to the implementation of a specific API and want to know all the clients of the API so you can make sure you won't impact anything.


### Description

GraphQL is a query language for APIs to describe how to [query](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/) and [manipulate](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations) data on the server.  


### Steps


#### GraphQL Schema



* [Direct Link](https://demo.sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/cmd/frontend/graphqlbackend/schema.graphql)

    This is a direct link to the schema file.  But, it's probably better to get there by searching :).

* **<code>repo:^github\.com/sourcegraph/* lang:graphql schema </code></strong>[[sg](https://demo.sourcegraph.com/search?q=repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/*+lang:graphql+schema&patternType=literal)]

    If you leave off "schema" you'll see a few other GraphQL schema files.  It's easy to get to the right one this way too (it's called <strong><code>schema.graphql</code></strong> in <strong><code>sourcegraph/sourcegraph</code></strong> repo)



#### Find the API



* Open **<code>schema.graphql</code></strong> in <strong><code>sourcegraph/sourcegraph</code></strong> repo
* Scroll down to the API you are going to use for this demo.  I like the <strong><code>createCodeMonitor</code></strong> mutation.  But, there are others in there that are just as good to use.


#### Code Intelligence



* Hover over the API and show the code intel features
* Click on the "**<code>Find references</code></strong>" link to open all the references to this API.  

    <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NOTE</span></strong>: This is a search-based result so make sure you pick a relatively unique API name.



#### Review the Callers



* Scroll through the results and find the Typescript results that are interesting.  For the **<code>createCodeMonitor </code></strong>example, you are looking for the result on <strong><code>CreateCodeMonitorPage.tsx</code></strong> (Line 20).
