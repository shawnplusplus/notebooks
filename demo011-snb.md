## Python 2 `->` 3 Migration


```
#python #type:good-for-campaigns #migration #structural-search
```



### Use Case

We're moving a large project from Python 2 to Python 3.


### Discussion

Python 2 is being deprecated.  The docs outline how to [migrate a project from v2 to v3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html).

Examples of the code we want to swap: [https://sourcegraph.com/refactor-python2-to-3](https://sourcegraph.com/refactor-python2-to-3); you can use search to find and change these, insights to track the pattern, and a batch change to run 2to3: https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html
