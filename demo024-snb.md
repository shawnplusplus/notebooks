## Find Examples of How Other Developers Use an Object


```
#structural-search #go
```



### Use Case

Developers who are new to a codebase want to follow best practices for how to call functions and pass parameters. 


### Value / Differentiation from other technologies

From Coury:


    _That was the particular query I wrote, that captures function parameters. In general structural search can match parameters so easy with context such as parameter location, etc._


    _This query was just to help me build some context on how other parts of the Sourcegraph codebase were initializing helper code with a provided DB_


### Description

This is a real-world example used by engineers at Sourcegraph (details from  [here](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C0B2RU51Q/p1632962415328500?thread_ts=1632932165.323900&cid=C0B2RU51Q)).
