## Cross repository code intelligence


```
#cross-repository #go #javascript #java #code-intelligence
```



### Use Case

Some functions will have cross dependencies where functions are defined and referenced in other repositories. 


### Value / Differentiation from other technologies


### Description

These are 3 different examples in different languages that will show code that is being used in a file and referenced in many other repositories while being defined in a main repository. The idea here is that you will be able to pull up an example of an implemented dependency (**<code>putIfAbsent, AxiosInstance, or multierror</code></strong>) and show that not only is it used in other repositories, but the definition is not in the original repository you found it in. 


### Steps


#### Java - [loom link](https://www.loom.com/share/446e0fc1df3d4bc4bf7bb6bd044573bc)



* **<code>repo:^github\.com/Netflix/Hystrix$ file:^hystrix-core/src/main/java/com/netflix/hystrix/HystrixRequestCache\.java</code></strong> [[sg](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/-/blob/hystrix-core/src/main/java/com/netflix/hystrix/HystrixRequestCache.java#L77:40)]
* Make sure you are in the file
* Highlight <strong><code>putIfAbsent</code></strong> (~line 80)
* Click on Find References and in the drawer that opens up make sure to select Show other repositories
    * This shows cross repository references of <strong><code>putIfAbsent</code></strong>
* Click on Definitions in the drawer navigation to see the definition of <strong><code>putIfAbsent</code></strong>


#### Javascript - [loom link](https://www.loom.com/share/a2ef32a776624186a6c7b67387388b47)



* **<code>repo:^github\.com/grafana/grafana$@78d53c5 file:^packages/grafana-toolkit/src/cli/utils/githubClient\.ts</code></strong> [[sg](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/grafana/grafana@78d53c5/-/blob/packages/grafana-toolkit/src/cli/utils/githubClient.ts)]
* Make sure you are in the file
* Highlight <strong><code>AxiosInstance</code></strong> (~line 22)
* Click on Find References and in the drawer that opens up make sure to select Show other repositories
    * This shows cross repository references of <strong><code>AxiosInstance</code></strong>
* Click on Definitions in the drawer navigation to see the definition of <strong><code>AxiosInstance</code></strong>


#### Go - [loom link](https://www.loom.com/share/b5c54fc898df4f20969a8e8969e4c475)



* Sourcegraph implements hashicorpâ€™s multierror repository
* **<code>repo:^github\.com/hashicorp/packer$@27d89ac file:^packer/core\.go</code></strong> [[sg](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/hashicorp/packer@27d89ac/-/blob/packer/core.go)]
* Make sure you are in the file
* See how ~line 16 we are including<strong><code> multierror "github.com/hashicorp/go-multierror"</code></strong>
* Highlight <strong><code>multierror.Append</code></strong> (~line 730)
* Click on Find References and in the drawer that opens up make sure to select Show other repositories
    * This shows cross repository references of <strong><code>Append</code></strong>
* Click on Definitions in the drawer navigation to see the definition of <strong><code>Append</code></strong>
